    "\n",
    "In this competition, you will work with a mortgage loan dataset, conduct exploratory data analysis, build machine learning models, and use them to explore a real-world societal challenge known as **fair lending**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will begin with an introduction to the concept of fair lending. This includes a discussion of how machine learning models are used for systematic decisioning of loans (i.e., whether an applicant is approved or not), and how models can be used to assess if the process is fair. You will complete the reading and then work with the provided dataset to solve a series of challenges. The challenges will vary in difficulty level, and they will push you to understand fairness, systems, data, coding, modeling, mathematics, and statistics. These are typical issues that a data scientist faces, and they will provide a glimpse into the world of a data scientist.\n",

    "#### Database\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a data storage structure that supports **CRUD commands**:  \n",
    "[C]reate, [R]etrieval, [U]pdate, and [D]elete operations.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The **CRUD commands** are minimal requirements for a database.  \n",
    "Commercial databases support many other requirements, such as fast response times and the ability to distribute data to multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an Excel spreadsheet is a database because it supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- creation: a new table can be created to store data\n",
    "- retrieval: data can be collected from a table in the spreadsheet  \n",
    "- update: data can be updated in a table (e.g., by inputting a new value in a cell)  \n",
    "- delete: one or more rows, columns, or the entire table can be deleted\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational Database\n",
    "In practice, our applicant dataset would be one table situated in a **relational database.**   \n",
    "Relational databases use a set of tables consisting of rows and columns to represent and store data organized into concepts.  \n",
    "Each concept would have its own table.  \n",
    "For example, there might be a table for applicants, another table for mortgage rate type, and another for loan term.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<p><center>table: mortgage_rate_type</center></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "| rate_type_id (integer)      | rate_type_description (string) |  \n",
    "| :-----------: | :-----------: |  \n",
    "| 0      | fixed       |  \n",
    "| 1   | floating        |  \n",
    "\n",
    "<p><center>table: loan_term</center></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "| term_id (integer)      | term_description (string) |  \n",
    "| :-----------: | :-----------: |  \n",
    "| 0      | 15yr       |  \n",
    "| 1   | 30yr        |  \n",
    "\n",
    "Structuring the data in this way minimizes redundancy and the chance for errors.  \n",
    "However, performing **queries** on the data, or information lookups, will often require joining the tables on common fields, or columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Key**  \n",
    "For each table, it is important to be able to uniquely identify a row.  \n",
    "This is done with the **primary key**.  \n",
    "In our mortgage dataset,  the `applicantid` serves as the primary key.  \n",

    "A common practice is to use a logistic regression (logreg) model for the underwriting decision.  \n",

    "This is the process of fitting the model.\n",
    "\n",

    "From the example sigmoid function, the FICO multiplier, or slope coefficient, was -0.006. This is quite small.  \n",
    "If we drew another sample of data, fit the model to the data, and estimated the slope coefficent, it would likely be different.  \n",
    "Perhaps this time, the coefficient might be 0.001. There is variability when measuring this quantity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The variability of the coefficient estimate is called the **standard error**.  \n",
    "The standard error can be used in a statistical test to determine if the coefficient estimate is **statistically significant (stat sig)**.  \n",
    "In this case, we want to know if the estimate is truly different from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process goes like this:\n",
    "- compute the estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$\n",
    "- compute the standard error se($\\hat{\\theta}$)\n",
    "- compute the ratio z = $\\hat{\\theta}$ / se($\\hat{\\theta}$)\n",
    "- compute the **p-value**. this is the probability of observing the estimate value or something more extreme assuming that the coefficient is zero.\n",
    "- for a sufficently small p-value (0.05 is a typical cutoff), we conclude statistical significance at the cutoff level\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to learn more about the p-value, you can find details on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value). This is optional.\n",
